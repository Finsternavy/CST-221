# CST-221
Assignments for CST-221

My name is Christopher Finster and I am currently a student at Grand Canyone University(GCU). CST-221 Operating Systems Concepts is the third Computer Science (CS) class I have taken at GCU. To this point, my background is primarily in Java programming.
I plan to complete my degree around the same time I complete my enlistment in the U.S. Navy. I have been serving for five and a half years thus far, with two and a half left on my current enlistment.
When I complete my degree, I plan to start a business with a friend creating assets for video game developers.
The commits to this repository will be various projects and assignment as I complete this course.
